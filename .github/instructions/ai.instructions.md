The `.ai` directory contains comprehensive documentation to help AI agents quickly understand and continue development on the project. It serves as a knowledge base for the project's architecture, features, and development process.

## Usage

1. You must always consult the `.ai` documentation when starting work on the project
2. Use the documentation to understand the project structure and conventions
3. Refer to specific files for detailed information:
   - `README.md`: Project overview and quick start
   - `COMMANDS.md`: Command system documentation
   - `ARCHITECTURE.md`: Key components and architecture
   - `DEVELOPMENT.md`: Setup and coding conventions

## Maintenance

1. Update the documentation when making significant changes to the project
2. Keep the documentation accurate and up-to-date
3. Add new sections when introducing major features or architectural changes
4. Remove outdated information promptly

## Decision Making

1. Use the documentation as a reference when making architectural decisions
2. Follow established patterns and conventions documented in `.ai`
3. Consider the impact of changes on documented components and features
4. Update documentation to reflect any approved changes
